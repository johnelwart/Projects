### CIE Programs
From Computers in Engineering (ENGR 2730) taken in the Spring of 2021. This class used C++ and all the programs saved in this folder are homework assignments for the class. Other classes that have used C++ have been Computer Science 1 (CSC 121) and Computer Science 2 (CSC 122) taken at McHenry County College.

### SWD Projects
From Intro to Software Design (ECE 3330) class taken in the Fall of 2021. This class uses Java and the projects in this folder were made for the oral exams or for the team project done at the end of the semester. Other classes that have used the Java language have been Computer Science 2: Data Structures (CS 2230) taken at University of Iowa.

### Embedded Systems Projects
From Embedded Systems (ECE 3360) class taken in the Spring of 2022. This class uses Assembly language and C. Projects in this folder are paired with an Arduino and breadboard to create various devices throughout the semester.

### Computer Architecture Project
From Computer Architecture & Organization (ECE 3350) class taken in the Spring of 2022. This class uses Verilog to create a Simple Instruction Set Computer (SISC) processor.

### CS1 Programs
From Computer Science 1: Fundamentals (CS:1210) class taken in the Summer of 2022. This class uses python and the programs in this folder are either lab assignments from the discussion section of this class or weekly homework assignments.

### Free Time Projects
These are projects Ive worked on in my free time either for practice or to learn a new skill. In this folder I have my first Android app that I am playing around with and also Assembly code that I am learning on my own.

### Notes
- Most of these projects are created by me with a few exceptions. In the CIE folder some of the homeworks, specifically the GUI ones, have code that was provided to us to work off of. Also in the Computer Architecture folder the Verilog files were provided to us and the individual component and test bench files were not changed during the course of the project. The only files that were modified were the sisc.v and ctrl.v files.

- The software design and embedded systems projects have a dedicated wiki page for each project that explains the project in more detail. Some of the descriptions of the projects were not written by me and those descriptions are marked at the beginning.

- Some of the titles of the files are not very descriptive of what they do, for explanations on what they are, check the wiki page.
