From Intro to Software Design (ECE 3330) class taken in the Fall of 2021. This class uses Java and the projects in this folder were made for the oral exams or for the team project done at the end of the semester. Other classes that have used the Java language have been Computer Science 2: Data Structures (CS 2230) taken at University of Iowa.

### Free Time Projects
These are projects Ive worked on in my free time either for practice or to learn a new skill. In this folder I have my first Android app that I am playing around with and also Assembly code that I am learning on my own.

### Other Notes
Projects from the other classes mentioned above were not included because the code was partially provided for us and we finished it as the assignment or the project simply wasnt all that interesting. All of these projects are done from scratch with given speciications by the course instructor
